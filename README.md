## Purpose
For a system with an electric heating or hot water boiler in combination with Solar PV.  
If you know the frequency and lenghts of switch-on phases, you can then save money with better control of your PV system.
For example you don't need to feed a boiler the whole night, but switch it on in suffiecient time before you use a hot water.

## Built With  
- Some power supply with DC voltage from 3V up to 5V. I have used an old clasical Nokia power supply with 3,7V.  
- Analog-to-digital converter ADS1115.   
- Raspberry Pi3.  

## Getting Started
You find a an [electrical schematic](https://github.com/jerry4174/Hot-water-boiler-monitor/wiki/Electrical-Schematic) and wiring diagram in the Wiki.
